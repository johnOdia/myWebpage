            <p>They may be similar concepts, however there are key differences between the two.<br>   
What is <b> Software Engineer</b>?
A software engineer is a professional who applies the principles of software engineering for designing, development, 
maintenance, testing, and evaluation of computer software <br>
<b> Software developers</b> are professionals who build software which runs across various types of computer. They write code from scratch. 
The application could be a desktop application like Photoshop, mobile apps like Instagram, web apps like Facebook, and Twitter.
